#System Monitoring Script

This is a bash script designed to monitor system resources and log the results to a file. It checks various aspects of your system's health, including:

Disk usage
CPU usage
Memory usage
Running processes (top 5 by CPU and memory usage)
The script outputs the results to a log file, and it also sends email notifications when certain thresholds are exceeded (specifically for disk usage).

Features
Disk Usage Monitoring: Checks the disk usage for each mounted filesystem and compares it to a predefined threshold. If usage exceeds the threshold (80% by default), it sends an email notification.
CPU Usage Monitoring: Retrieves the current CPU usage.
Memory Usage Monitoring: Shows total, used, and free memory, along with the percentage of memory used.
Running Processes Monitoring: Displays the top 5 processes by CPU and memory usage.
Log File: Appends the results to a log file and includes timestamps for each new report.
Prerequisites
Linux or Unix-based system
mutt installed for email notifications (you need to configure it with an SMTP server)
Bash shell (default on most Linux/Unix systems)
Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local system.

Ensure the mutt command is configured to send emails. If itâ€™s not configured, follow this guide to set it up.

Set the correct path for the LOG_FILE variable in the script (currently set to /home/ali/scripts/task1/monitor_system_script/test.log).

Make the script executable:

bash
Copy
chmod +x monitor_system.sh
Usage
Run the script manually:

bash
Copy
./monitor_system.sh
You can set up a cron job to run the script at a regular interval (e.g., every hour):

bash
Copy
crontab -e
Add the following line to run the script every hour:

bash
Copy
0 * * * * /path/to/monitor_system.sh
Configuration
Disk Usage Threshold: The disk usage threshold is currently set to 80%. You can change it by modifying the THRESHOLD variable in the script.

Log File Location: The results are logged to /home/ali/scripts/task1/monitor_system_script/test.log. You can change the path by modifying the LOG_FILE variable in the script.

Email Notifications: Modify the email address in the following line to send notifications to a different address:

bash
Copy
system("echo \"Warning: Disk usage for " mount_point " is at " usage "%. Please take action.\" | mutt -s \"Disk Usage Alert\" mmazen.m23@gmail.com")
